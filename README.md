This project focuses on leveraging technology to identify and map the spread of infectious and pandemic diseases, enabling efficient prediction and management of disease distribution.

## Concept  
1. **Disease Identification**:  
   - Utilize images of patients to analyze and identify disease characteristics.  
   - Implement image processing techniques to detect signs of infectious diseases.  

2. **Disease Mapping**:  
   - Once identified, map the spread of the disease geographically.  
   - Predict disease distribution patterns to aid in timely interventions.  

## Features  
- **Image Analysis**: Detect disease traits from patient photos using [insert technology, e.g., AI or ML].  
- **Mapping Tool**: Visualize pandemic hotspots and spread using advanced mapping techniques.  
- **Predictive Analytics**: Anticipate disease distribution trends for proactive measures.

## Objectives  
- Improve disease detection accuracy through automated analysis.  
- Provide real-time mapping of disease spread to aid healthcare providers.  
- Enhance preparedness with predictive insights for future outbreaks.  

## How to Use  
1. Upload images for disease analysis.  
2. View the identified disease characteristics.  
3. Access the interactive map for disease distribution.  
4. Use prediction reports for future planning.
